# 🛒 Amazon Product Scraper

A clean, modular web scraper for Amazon product listings and details, built with Python and structured using a clean architecture approach.

This scraper allows you to extract key product data (like titles, prices, ratings, and more) and explore it via a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search for any product on Amazon by keyword  
- 🌍 Supports location-based scraping (e.g. `us`, `uk`, `fr`)  
- 🧠 Clean and maintainable architecture (controllers, models, enums, helpers)  
- 🧵 Multi-threaded for improved performance  
- 🖥️ Streamlit UI for interactive use  
- 📦 Organized codebase ready for extensions (LLM integration, analysis, etc.)

## 🌿 Branch Structure

This project is organized into four development branches, each representing a major step in the project’s lifecycle:

- `scraper_001`: sets up the environment and clean folder architecture (no scraper code yet)
- `scraper_002`: implements the scraping pipeline and controller logic
- `scraper_003`: adds the Streamlit user interface for interacting with the scraper
- `scraper_004`: prepares the branch for optional LLM integration to enhance functionality

Switching between branches lets you explore the project step by step and understand its evolution.

#### 💡 How It Works

1. **Product Listing Scrape**  
   Using `scraper_controller.py`, the script navigates to Amazon search results and collects product blocks.

2. **Product Page Scrape**  
   For each product, the scraper fetches its detailed page and extracts structured data.

3. **Streamlit UI**  
   Run the app and search interactively from your browser!
